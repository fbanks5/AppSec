## ðŸ”¥ Risk Prioritization

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical | 10 (Snyk) |
| High     | 6 (Snyk/SAST) |
| Medium   | 4 (DAST/SAST) |

**Business Risk Impact:**  
Unpatched vulnerabilities may lead to:
- Full account compromise via SQL injection
- Data leakage via misconfigured CORS or JS includes
- Credential exposure from hardcoded secrets
- DoS conditions from ReDoS or excessive parsing

---

## âœ… Recommendations

- **DAST Fixes:** Apply CSP headers, tighten CORS policy, limit JS origins
- **SAST Fixes:** Refactor vulnerable Sequelize queries and remove hardcoded secrets
- **SCA Fixes:** Upgrade vulnerable NPM packages using `npm audit fix` and/or `snyk wizard`
- **SDLC:** Adopt secure coding practices and integrate SAST/SCA/DAST into CI/CD
