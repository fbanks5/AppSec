# OWASP ZAP Scan Summary
**Scan Date:** May 14, 2025  
**Target:** http://host.docker.internal:3000  
**ZAP Version:** 2.16.1

## ⚠️ Top 3 Security Issues

---

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Instances:** 11  
**Description:**  
The application does not define a Content Security Policy, which helps mitigate threats like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by restricting the sources from which content can be loaded.

**Business Impact:**  
Without a CSP, the app is more vulnerable to malicious scripts or data injections. This could result in session hijacking, malware distribution, or data leakage.

**Mitigation:**  
Configure your web server or application to include a secure `Content-Security-Policy` header.

### 2. Cross-Domain Misconfiguration (CORS)
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Instances:** 10  
**Description:**  
The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` header allows any origin to access resources, leading to potential unauthorized access to sensitive data via cross-site scripting.

**Business Impact:**  
Attackers can abuse this misconfiguration to retrieve potentially sensitive data from public APIs or files meant to be restricted to trusted domains.

**Mitigation:**  
Limit CORS to specific trusted domains by replacing `*` with specific origin values in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header.

### 3. Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion
**Risk Level:** Low  
**Instances:** 10  
**Description:**  
External JavaScript files are being loaded from third-party domains without integrity verification.

**Business Impact:**  
If any external JS source is compromised, attackers could inject malicious scripts into your application.

**Mitigation:**
- Host scripts locally if possible.
- Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) to verify external scripts.
- Regularly audit third-party sources for reputation and security.
